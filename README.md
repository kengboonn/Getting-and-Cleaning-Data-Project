# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

Course project (Week 4) for Getting and Cleaning Data by Johns Hopkins University

Outline for course project
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

runanalysis is written in a systematic way to achieve the outline for the course as stated above.

The script will merge all data into a single dataframe, label all the variables, and reshape and aggregating the data to output a tidy dataframe as per the requirements of this project.
